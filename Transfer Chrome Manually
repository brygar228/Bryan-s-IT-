For users that are remote and need to transfer their chrome browser data (bookmarks and passwords) and don't have a gmail to sync thier chrome data.
Best use would be for them to make a folder on their OneDrive as a backup to save these if they need then later and the computer can not be accessed for some reason like damage or corrupt computer. 


For user:
"Make a Folder on the main page of your OneDrive called "Chrome Data Transfer" in there you will paste the exported Bookmark and Password files.  
Here is a link on how to do the next steps: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en     
Go to the "Move or export bookmarks to another browser" section,
follow those steps and put the HTML file in the Chrome Transfer Folder.  

For your passwords saved in the Google Password Manager use this link for steps: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13068232?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop      
Go to the "Export passwords from Google Password Manager" section and upload that file also to the Chrome Transfer folder.  

Use those the steps in those links to upload the files to your new chrome browser.
Let me know if you have any questions or need help."

If the user can't or is upset/ seeking a faster resolution remote in or do a teams session and take control.
